                While we analyze your data, we want to quickly tell you a bit
                more about our philosophy. It boils down to two principals:
                {' '}<strong>pay yourself first</strong> and
                {' '}<strong>live within your means</strong>. These two
                simple concepts can help make you rich and achieve financial
                freedom. Weâ€™re here to show you the way.
              </p>

              <h4>Pay Yourself First</h4>
              <p>
                Paying yourself first means making your own long-term financial
                well-being your top priority. You set your goals for saving and
                investing money, and we'll make sure it's taken off the top each
                month.
              </p>

              <h4>Live Within Your Means</h4>
              <p>
                After paying yourself, you'll have some money left over. Don't
                spend more then that in a given month. We can help there by
                showing you how much you've spent so far this month, and how much
                you have left to spend across all your accounts and credit cards.
              </p>
